# 👋 Hi, I'm Sumukh Adiraju

**AI-Powered Builder • Systems Engineer • Rapid Prototyper**

I'm an engineering student at Imperial College London who loves turning bold ideas into real, usable tools — fast. I specialize in building agentic systems, AI-powered developer tools, and full-stack apps that reduce friction in creation.

- 🧠 **Built “HazardVision” at Berkeley AI Hackathon** – CNN + LLMs for threat analysis
- ⚙️ **Clarify** – AI-powered syllabus-to-course generator for personalized learning (Check it out here: https://clarify-ivory.vercel.app/)
- 🤖 **HazardVision** – Context-aware workplace security using YOLOv8 + LLM threat classification

### 🚀 What I Do
- LLM systems & agent orchestration (Claude, OpenAI, Groq)
- Full-stack dev (Next.js, Node.js, Supabase, Tailwind, Express)
- Automation, integrations, and rapid deployment
- Hackathon-first mindset: fast iterations, clarity in purpose, results over polish

### 💻 Technologies
- **Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, C++
- **Frameworks:** React, Node.js, Express, Electron
- **Tools:** Supabase, Runware, Vercel, Docker, ACI.dev, Requesyt
- **AI/ML:** YOLOv8, LLMs, prompt engineering, agent flows
